The most crucial life defining factor is time. Amount of time lost and the amount of time left will forever be undetermined and uncalculated. The inception for the Lecture Scheduling System concept seeded based on the necessity of saving time. Making lecture scheduling more convenient and easier for lecturers and accessing and viewing timetables for the students stands as the main intentions of this system.
The Lecture Scheduling and Management System is an application developed for the ease of scheduling lectures by lecturers and accessing scheduled timetables by the students. The lecturers and the students will have their own accounts which they use to login to the system and the system as a whole will be managed by an administrator who will keep track of all the lecturers and students logged into and registered within the system. The lecturers have the ability to login to the system with their provided email and insert their own password, which can be changed if forgotten using the same email, and view pre scheduled lectures with the allocated hall and time slots. The lecturers also have the ease of scheduling more lectures, if any, and reschedule or delete an existing lecture.
